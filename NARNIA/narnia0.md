In the code snippet you provided, there is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the scanf function call. The scanf function reads up to 24 characters 

from standard input into the buffer buf, but it does not perform any bounds checking, so an attacker could enter more than 24 characters and overflow
the buffer.

Assuming that the buffer overflow is successful, it would overwrite the value of val on the stack, which is located immediately after buf in memory.
Since val is a 32-bit integer, it occupies four bytes of memory. Therefore, an attacker would need to overflow the buffer by at least four bytes to
overwrite the value of val.

The point of the value being little endian is that it affects the way the value is represented in memory. In little endian byte order, the least
significant byte of a multi-byte value is stored first, followed by the next least significant byte, and so on, until the most significant byte is 
stored last. This is the opposite of big endian byte order, where the most significant byte is stored first.

In the case of the val variable in the code snippet, the value 0xdeadbeef would be represented in little endian byte order as the byte sequence efbeadde.
Therefore, if an attacker overflows the buffer buf with this byte sequence, it would overwrite the value of val with the desired value of 0xdeadbeef.
