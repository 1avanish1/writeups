About robots.txt
A robots. txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site.
This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google.
To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page.
